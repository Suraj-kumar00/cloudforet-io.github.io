There are three types of users that can be added as follows:
- **Internal user**: users who can sign in by using their ID and password on the login page
- **External user**: users added by following the external user authentication that the domain has
- **API Only**: users who are only able to use API, and for whom the Cloudforet console is not accessible
<br>

### 1. Adding internal users
Internal users are users who can sign in by using their IDs and passwords on the login page.

(1-1) After the [Add user] modal dialog opens, select the [Local] tab to add an internal user.

![user-create-modal-local](/docs/guides/administration/iam-user-img/user-create-modal-local_en.png)

(1-2) After entering the ID of an internal user, click the [Check ID] button. The user ID must be in an email form, and not on the list of existing users.

(1-3) Optionally enter user name and notification email(for receiving important system-related announcements or password reset link).

(1-4) Either send user a password reset link or, set the password on user's behalf. (â€» If you set the password manually, you will need to directly inform the user of the password)

(1-5) To assign admin role to the user, you can activate the 'Admin Role' section at the bottom of the modal window and grant a specific role.

## Updating users
By selecting a specific user in the table and clicking on [Actions > Edit], you can modify the user's information.

![user-update-modal](/docs/guides/administration/iam-user-img/user-update-modal_en.png)

- You can modify the user's ID, name, notification email, password, admin role (role), and tags. 
- If the user encounters difficulties with verification for the notification email, you can directly verify it without sending verification code.  
- For local users, you can either change the password on their behalf or send them a password reset link for the user to reset it themselves.
