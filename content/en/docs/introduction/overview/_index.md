## Main Features

### The Need for Multi-Cloud Environments

Cloud computing has become a critical technology for businesses, offering flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency. However, multi-cloud environments, which use the services of multiple cloud providers, can introduce complexity and management challenges.

### Key reasons for adopting a multi-cloud strategy include:

* **Optimal Service Selection**: Different cloud providers offer a variety of services, and a multi-cloud environment allows businesses to choose the best service for their specific needs.
* **Cost Optimization**: By leveraging multiple providers, businesses can play them off against each other to drive down costs.
* **Avoiding Service Disruption**: If one cloud provider experiences an outage, businesses can continue operating without interruption by using another provider's services.
* **Regulatory Compliance**: A multi-cloud environment can facilitate regulatory compliance by storing data in multiple regions.
